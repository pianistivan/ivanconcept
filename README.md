# About ivanconcept

Hi! Welcome to my personal portfolio, ivanconcept

# Design and Styling

To give a more sophisticated and modern feel to the website, the following styling decisions were made:

**Color Palette**: Dark, muted, gradient-coloured text for highlighting

**Font**: Domine (serif), Roboto (sans serif) from Google Fonts

**Media**: Use of fullscreen images/gifs and minimal text

**UX**: Light animation

# User Interaction

Users will be able to interact with the website through:

**Navigation bar**: Bootstrap implementation, with smooth-scroll, styling changes when hover and active section links

**Animation**: jQuery DrawSVG, lax.js

**Mouse events**: CSS hover,custom javascript tracks which section the user has scrolled to
