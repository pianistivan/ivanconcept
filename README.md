# About Ivan's Personal Website

Hi! Welcome to my experiment using Pts.js to draw an analogy between music and coding.

I connected my custom domain name http://ivanconcept.com to this page hosted on the Github.

# Design and Styling

To give a more sophisticated and modern feel to the website, the following styling decisions were made:

**Color Palette**: Dark, muted, gradient-coloured text for highlighting

**Font**: Domine (serif), Roboto (sans serif) from Google Fonts

**Media**: Use of fullscreen images/gifs and minimal text

**UX**: Light animation

# User Interaction

Users will be able to interact with the website through:

**Navigation bar**: Bootstrap implementation, with smooth-scroll, styling changes when hover and active section links

**Animation**: Animate CSS, Wow.js, Typeit.js, Pts.js

**Mouse events**: CSS hover, Pts.js, custom javascript tracks which section the user has scrolled to
